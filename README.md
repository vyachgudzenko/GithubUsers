A small test. The task is to display a list of Github users using the API, specifically https://api.github.com/users.
Two screens needed to be created: home and favorites. In the home screen, a list of all users should be displayed, and the user should be able to save/delete them to/from favorites.
The favorites screen displays selected users, and they can be deleted from there. If you click on a user, you will be taken to a screen with all of their repositories. When you click on a repository cell, a browser will open with that repository.
